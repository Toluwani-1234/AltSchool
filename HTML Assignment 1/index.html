    <h3>Why Did I Join AltSchool Africa?</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, I'm a perso who loves to actively grow and improve
      in anything I do. This high-sense of ambition has made me realize that
      learning never stops. This is one of the main reasons I joined AltSchool,
      the community that refines the learing process, the active learning
      circles, the amazing networking opportunities, and many more. <br />
      One of major goals i've set while I'm still in AltSchool is to expand my
      horizon and build meaningful conects and networks. This is already under
      development as I got to meet with people with like minds during the stArT
      conference last week. Learning isn't left out too, I'm always excited to
      hop on new lessons on the LMS whenever they are available, improve my
      skillset and impact my environment positively, is possible also, give back
      to the community.
